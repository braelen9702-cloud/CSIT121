           <p>During my first time creating a webpage, i have been struggling alot with the new information i have been learning,
            like forgetting the kinds of code is used in a HTML and where to put it. But one of the things I have found interesting,
            was how HTML is known to have its own family tree of different kinds of paths to use it. trying to understand everything is
            difficult for now, slowly going through everything could help alot.</p>

            <h2>What i learned</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>There are 6 levels of heading</li>

              <li>HTML has elements</li>

              <li>The body element contains all content I want to show</li>
            <ul>
              
                <h3>What I learned from</h3>
