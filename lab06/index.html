    <h2>My site choice</h2>
    <p>I chose to evaluate the Morgan State university website. If possible morgan would be the school choise for me if i wanted to pursue a higher degree
        in my IT/Cybersecurity journey.</p>
        <h2>What is the name of the website</h2>
        <p>The name of the website is Morgan State university</p>
        <h2>Who is the site's target audience</h2>
        <p>I would say the target audience if for the people who want the college experience
            as well as a chance of getting a degree for the major they chose or even more.</p>
            <h2>How is the cite organized</h2>
            <p> The site is organized in a way that makes the home page look more visually stunning
                to the audience, showing slideshows of the campus life as well as students learning.
                It also shows the links on the top left that guides users to where they want to 
                get infomation from.</p>
                <h2>The CRAP principle</h2>
                <p>The repitition is shown throughout the website giving similar colors to each section 
                    as well as styles and sizes giving a consistent look to the cite that makes it almost addictive
                    to look at.
                    <h2>The Audit score</h2>
                    <p>The accesibility checker shows that the site has a 89% audit score.</p>
                    <h2>Whats the sites effective</h2>
                    <p>The site is very effective I have had no problems with the links at all, I am able to 
                        navigate through the site with ease finding what i need  as well as 
                        looking as the live films of the school life in the home page, showing no signs of lag or any other issues</p>
                        <h2>What is the sites effenciency</h2>
                        <p>I have had no issues getting into the website as well as no problems clicking
                            into links and getting me where i need to go quickly and easily with no complaints
                            i have been able to click what i want with ease without any issue and print everything i would need
                            from the site.</p>
                            <h2>Engagement</h2>
                            <p>The site has a very smooth way of engaging the users to want to explor the
                                website more with its pictures and big fonts  as well as colors.</p>
                                <h2>What to improve</h2>
                                <p>I personally think the home page links would be a bit more 
                                    better if they were a bit bigger and more visible to the eye. I
                                    dont like the idea of all the tabs being on the top left corner.</p>
