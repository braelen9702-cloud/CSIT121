       <section>
        <p>     DID are special IDs that start with did and point to a person, group,
            device, or thing. They work like usernames but are more private and not tied
            to one company. When yo add extra parts like a path, you get a DID URL pointing
            to a specific item, like a key or service. DID represents the subject, and whoever can update
            its information is the controller.
        </p>
        <p>     DIDs are stored on trusted systems called verifiable data registries,
            such as blockchains or secure databases. Each DID is linked to a DID 
            doc, which is like a small profile page for that subject. This document lists public keys
            and service endpoints so others know how to talk or verify safely.It can be updated, 
            but under certain rules.
        </p>
        <p>     The rules say which DID is created, found, changed, or turned off.
            A DID resolver is a tool that takes a DID and returns its DID document,
            this steo is the resolution. When you use a full DID URL, a DID URL fetches
            the exact resource. DID URL dereferencing lets apps grab keys or services 
            linked to that DID. Together, methods, resolvers, and deferencers keep the
            system working behind the scenes.
