            <h3>Privacy and Control</h3>

            <p>Decentralized Identity puts you in charge of your own personal information.
                rather than give all data to companys or apps you share the specific details that are needed.
                You also get to choose exactly who can see that info. Because of this your data stays more private and protected.
            </p>
            <h3>Transferring sensitive patient information between health providers</h3>

            <p>Patient information is shared using digital identifiers and Verifiable Credentials. Each blood test result or cancer treatment report is turned into a verifiable credential
                tied to a DID. Even doctors or the pharmacy have there own DID. When patient gives permission, the providers can access
                the VC to see the information securely and line in with privacy regulations.
             </p>
             <h3>Issuing ID's for citizens/Tracking someones training within a company</h3>
             <p>A government agency can create digital state IDs as Verifiable Credentials that keep in a wallet app on phones as well as a physical card.
                Furthermore, A company uses DID to keep track of employees growing skills.
                Every staff is assigned a DID that is recorded in the system. When someone completes a training
                they recive a VC that can be viewed anytime.
                 </p>
                 <h3>Extra</h3>

                 <p>It changes the way we handle and prove who we are online. Instead of relying on centralized platforms,
                    they let people take back control of their own identity. DID supports the idea of self-sovereign identity,
                    deciding who you want to show. They also provide a flexible way to create, manage, and verify 
                    digital ideneities across systems.
                 </p>

                 <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                 <p>Moving from traditional logins to DID gives people a better choice.
                    DID lets organizations issue trusting credentials, give people real control over their data,
                    and allow development to skip passwords and third-party logins together.</p>
