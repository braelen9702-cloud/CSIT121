        <h2>What is DID</h2>
        <section>
        <p>     A Decentrlized identifier, is a type of ID for the webs that a person,
            orgnization, or device controls themselves. It is a special type of web address that points to a DID document, holding
            cryptographic keys and other information to know who controld it and how to interact. Its like a
            digital passport or drivers license that you control instead of a company or
            government. A DID lets you prove who you are online without handing your 
            personal info to webs or even apps.</p>

               <p> DID originally started as an idea for giving
            people private, self controlled digital identities. Overtime, tech and standards
            grown and improved but with that new problems started while the standards keep on 
            evolving to support the new challenges. DID methods are like recipes, for how DID is 
            created, looked up, and managed on a certain system or network. The methods fit different cases or platforms.
            For an example.

            <h2>"A DID looks like a special URL"</h2>
            <p>DID:example:123456789abbcdefghi</p>
            
            <p>DID:ethr would be on the Ethereum blockchain while the did:web uses regular websites to manage DID.
            DID's also have documents which includes public keys, service endpoints and more.</p>

               <p> DID's are different from emails or usernames because they are decentralized meaning you create and control them instead of
            a company like google or facebook. They work across many apps and systems. You get more privacy control over personal details aswell.
            You decide what information is linked to your DID and who can see it.</p>
