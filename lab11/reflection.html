            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p> Compleating this project has taught me alot about web development and 
                how much detail goes into creating clean and effecient websites. I have momment where
                I struggled with figuiring out why links are connected to the wrong pages or how come my validations aren't fully
                fixed to where i want it to be. But as i said before i plan to continue learning web development and 
                getting better at what i lack in. I learned how to adjust designs and color to make website more appealing and how to fix incorrect
                code. Overall through the modules to me I have made good progress since the beginning of the course.
                <h2>Screens</h2>
                <p>Testing my website on different browsers and on a mobile device helped me 
                    understand why responsive design is important. I understand how some pages look 
                    different depending the screen size, so creating layouts or fixing the spacing could help. 
                    Learning how to use media queries as well as flexbox has taught me how to make my websites more visibal 
                    and appealing to the audience.
                </p>
                <h2>Through out the course</h2>
                <p>I learned the foundations of HTML, CSS, UI/UX, and other web standards. I now understand how to structure
                    web pages using elements, how to style my websites in CSS as well as how it makes things more appealing,
                    and how certain kinds of elements play a role in user experience and accessibility. This course has 
                    givin me the confidence to continue studying web development and has prepared me to understand it more to reach an 
                    advanced level.
